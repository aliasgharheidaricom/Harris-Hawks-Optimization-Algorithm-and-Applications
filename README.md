<p align="center">
  <strong>The <span style="color:#E24E1B;">Harris Hawks Optimization (HHO)</span> algorithm</strong> is inspired by the cooperative hunting strategies of Harris' hawks. It mimics their dynamic tactics for trapping prey, making it an efficient method for solving complex optimization problems.
</p>

<p align="center">
  HHO combines adaptive exploration and exploitation strategies to solve problems in fields such as machine learning, engineering, and resource allocation.

## Workflow of HHO

The algorithm operates in three phases, shifting between exploration and exploitation dynamically based on the prey's energy state.

| **Phase**            | **Description**                                                                                  | **Purpose**                                           |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| **Exploration**       | Hawks search broadly by spreading out across the search space.                                   | To discover promising regions of the solution space.  |
| **Transition**        | Decisions are made based on the prey's energy (problem difficulty) to switch between strategies. | To balance exploration and exploitation.              |
| **Exploitation**      | Hawks focus on refining solutions near the best-known position (the prey).                       | To converge on the optimal solution efficiently.      |

## Algorithm Steps

### Step-by-Step Explanation

| **Step**               | **Description**                                                                                           |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **1. Initialization**  | Hawks (candidate solutions) are initialized randomly in the search space.                               |
| **2. Fitness Evaluation** | Each hawk's performance is evaluated based on a fitness function specific to the optimization problem. |
| **3. Best Solution Tracking** | The algorithm tracks the "rabbit" (best solution found so far).                                    |
| **4. Exploration or Exploitation** | Based on the prey's energy, hawks decide whether to explore or exploit.                       |
| **5. Dynamic Adjustments** | Hawks adapt their positions using encircling, sudden dives, or random movements.                      |
| **6. Stopping Criterion** | The process repeats until a stopping condition (e.g., maximum iterations) is met.                     |
| **7. Output**           | The best solution is returned as the final result.                                                     |

## Exploration Phase

In this phase:
- Hawks randomly explore different parts of the search space.  
- Some hawks move to random positions, while others investigate areas close to the best-known solution.  
This randomness ensures diversity and prevents premature convergence.

---

## Exploitation Phase

Once a promising solution is found:
- Hawks use several strategies to refine the solution:  
  1. **Gradual Encircling**: Hawks gradually close in on the prey.  
  2. **Sudden Dives**: Hawks make abrupt changes to test nearby solutions.  
  3. **Direct Attack**: If the prey is "weak," hawks converge aggressively.  

These tactics allow fine-tuning without losing flexibility.

## Pseudo-Code

Below is a pseudo-code representation of the HHO algorithm for better understanding:

```plaintext
1. Initialize hawk positions randomly in the search space.
2. Evaluate the fitness of each hawk.
3. Identify the best solution (rabbit).
4. Repeat until stopping criterion is met:
   a. Update the energy of the prey.
   b. Adjust hawk positions based on exploration or exploitation:
      i. Random jumps for exploration.
      ii. Gradual encircling or dives for exploitation.
   c. Evaluate fitness and update the best solution if needed.
5. Return the best solution found.
```
